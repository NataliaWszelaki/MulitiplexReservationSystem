# Multiplex Reservation System

## Project description
The project is a business model of a cinema multiplex system.  
It supports multiple cinemas, each containing multiple halls and screenings.

The system allows:
- managing multiple cinemas
- checking programme for the next week
- buying tickets in advance
- reserving seats before the screening
- purchasing tickets without an account
- handling VIP and 3D screenings
- checking customer tickets

The project contains only the business logic (no database, no GUI).
